<h2>Getting Started with <code>CppUTest</code></h2>
    
    <p>If you want to experiment with a testing framework such as
    CppUnitLite, the framework CppUTest is very similar. And it's
    already installed on your vagrant virtual machine.</p>

<p>You should start by looking at
  the <a href="http://cpputest.github.io/manual.html">manual</a>,
  which has some simple example near the beginning. The manual also
  talks about some requirements to any <code>makefile</code> you use
  with CppUTest; to summarize, the makefile for any project in which you want to use CppUTest needs to include a few definitions:

      <code>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
          <li>export CPPUTEST_HOME=/usr/share</li>
          <li>CPPFLAGS += -I$(CPPUTEST_HOME)/include</li>
          <li>LD_LIBRARIES = -L$(CPPUTEST_HOME)/lib -lCppUTest -lCppUTestExt</li>
        </ul>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      And the recipe to link your executable needs to look something like</p>

    <p><code>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
          <li>test: test.o</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;g++ -g  -o test test.o $(LD_LIBRARIES)</li>
          </ul>
        </code>
    </p>
