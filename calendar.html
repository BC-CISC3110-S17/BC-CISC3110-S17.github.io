      <h3>Course Calendars</h3>

      <p>Subject to revision!</p>

      <p>I will post the College's final exam schedule here as soon as it's available; please make sure  that your exam for this class doesn't conflict with others in your schedule; I  will <em>not</em> be able to accommodate rescheduling your final. </p>

      <p>The resources listed for each day are items I expect you to have read/prepared <em>before</em> class meets.</p>

You may also want to review this reading again before class!</p>

            <p>Additionally, you may want to review this <a href="http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html">C++ Style Guide</a>, which is a good summary of how I expect your code to look: how to name variables and functions, how to use whitespace, and so on. Some items here won't affect us yet, but they will soon! One thing that's not quite clear in the guide: every function, class, and method you write you should be preceded by a short description of what it does. Each line of that description should be preceded by <code>///</code> (yes, THREE slashes) to distinguish those descriptions from the short comments you might use to annotate your implementation.</p>
