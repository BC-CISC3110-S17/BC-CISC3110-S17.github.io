<h4>vi/vim</h4>

        <p>Vim is an editor that's nearly 25 years old, yet still has
        incredible popularity among Linux users (and StackOverflow
        readers). It takes some getting used to, but with a bit of
        practice, you can become a very fast programmer, constrained
        only by the speed of your brain.</p>
     <p>Here is a sequence of 4 short videos on using vim (thanks, Stan!):
          <ul>
            <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI8TeVMX8pk</li>
            <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3OO7ZIOaJE</li>

            <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYD5gwgZIA</li>
          </ul>

          <p> There's a great online interactive tutorial at <a href="openvim.com">openvim.com</a>.
          </p>

     <p>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TX3kV3TICU">a
            video</a> on how vim can help you reduce your typing (and speed up
          your work). And here's
          a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnUiHLYZgaA">couple
            dudes talking</a> (with some illustration/demonstration) about
          some of the ways you can go from beginning vim user to pretty
          fast vim user.</p>

          <p>In your vagrant installation, I've included a
            code-completion plugin for vim
            called <a href="https://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/">YouCompleteMe</a>,
            which may be useful to you. Read the User Guide.
            Additionally, you may want to install additional plugins:
            read <a href="http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/21/learning-vim-in-2014-getting-more-from-vim-with-plugins/">this
            article</a> for a HOW-TO (the <code>
              Vundle
            </code> plugin manager is also installed in your Vagrant installation.
            ) </p>

        <p>If you really want to get crazy, <a href="http://www.alexeyshmalko.com/2014/using-vim-as-c-cpp-ide/">here</a> is an interesting discussion about how to use vim as an IDE for C++. Interesting reading, at the very least. If you're interested in installing some of the packages he recommends, but aren't sure what to do, shoot me an email.</p>

          

          <h4>Emacs</h4>

        <p>Emacs is definitely unlike any editor you've ever used. It
        will initially seem very strange! But experienced Emacs users
        are able to do some fairly incredible things while they're
        writing code. Emacs itself has been in continual development
        for 40 years&mdash;you might like to read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacss">history
            on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
        <p>Probably the best way to start understanding emacs is to use
             the built-in to tutorial--run emacs, then press Ctrl-h followed by t.</p>

        <p>On your vagrant installation, I've provided a version of
        Emacs known as "Prelude," which comes with several features
        that make it easier to work with code. Check out the "Getting
          to Know Prelude" section of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude#getting-to-know-prelude">manual</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Here
          are <a href="http://emacsnyc.org/assets/documents/emacs-the-editor-of-a-lifetime.pdf">slides</a>
          from a talk by someone who has used emacs for over 30 years.
          (The video of the talk
          is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8">here</a>,
          but the audience is really annoying....) And here's
          a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6jfrrwR10k">video</a>
          that illustrates some cool features of emacs, trying to
            impress you if you're new to emacs.
          Finally, <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/">site</a> contains
          several short videos by a programmer is really enthusiastic
          about Emacs.</p>

     

<h4><code>g++</code></h4>

     <p>Here's a very
     good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSZLNYF4Klo">7-minute
     video</a> explaining the compilation process (they talk about the
     Clang C compiler, but it's exactly the same for g++). (Thanks, Theodore)</p>

        <p>If you're curious about the preprocessor, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/index.html">here</a> is the very detailed manual. This is way more information than most people need, but the "Overview" section may be of interest.</p>
